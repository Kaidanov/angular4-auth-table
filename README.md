## Angular 5 Data Table

[Angular 2 data table](https://github.com/ggmod/angular-2-data-table) updated for Angular 5. It looks the same as the [old demo](https://ggmod.github.io/angular-2-data-table-demo)

Run it with `ng serve -o` using the angular cli.
(Packaging it as an npm library proved to be impractical last time because of the many issues with reusable angular component libraries)

Also added an Auth0 implementation
